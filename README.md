# Deck Post Skirt or Footing Trim

* This is a 3D model designed to be printed with an FDM 3D printer
* This "deck post skirt" is a two-piece skirt that fits around the bottom of the post, to hide the base of the post and the bolts holding the foot of the posts to the deck
* These come in two sizes.  The external measurements are the same for both.
    * The first has an opening for a post measuring 52.22mm by 52.22mm
    * The second is unknown at this moment!
* Some words to help with SEO: 
    * Deck post flare
    * Deck post base cover
    * Post base trim
    * Railing post base
    * Post skirt dressing
