# Deck Post Skirt or Footing Trim

* This is a 3D model designed to be printed with an FDM 3D printer
* This "deck post skirt" is a two-piece skirt that fits around the bottom of the post, to hide the base of the post and the bolts holding the foot of the posts to the deck
* These come in two sizes.  The external measurements are the same for both.
    * The first has an opening for a post measuring 52.22mm by 52.22mm
    * The second is unknown at this moment!

## Status: 2022 Sept. 18, v0.0.2 -  relieved edges

* Improved in several ways: 
    * Thicker walls
    * Rounded edges
    * Better orientation for slicing
* Initial printing says it's not compatible with v0.0.1

## Status: 2022 Sept. 10, v0.0.1 - first version

* This is a work in progress.  
* I printed a pair of these and tried them on the target post.  They fit really nicely.  Quite chuffed at how well they fit, actually, and on first attempt.
